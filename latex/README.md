LaTeX templates for your research proposal and thesis/dissertation. 

It includes a basic structure, formatting, and a quick-start guide to install TeXstudio and MiKTeX.

Special thanks to **Jocelyne Smith** for compiling and preparing the templates.

Set TeXstudio to use the XeLaTeX compiler instead of the default pdfLaTeX. 
Required if you want to use system fonts like Arial, Calibri, etc.
