LaTeX templates for your research proposal and thesis/dissertation. 

It includes a basic structure, formatting, and a quick-start guide to install TeXstudio and MiKTeX.

Please be sure to use this template when preparing your proposal. Let me know if you run into any issues with setup or compilation.

Special thanks to **Jocelyne Smith** for compiling and preparing the templates.

*UPDATED: 2025/06/11*

Set TeXstudio to use the XeLaTeX compiler instead of the default pdfLaTeX. 
Required if you want to use system fonts like Arial, Calibri, etc.
