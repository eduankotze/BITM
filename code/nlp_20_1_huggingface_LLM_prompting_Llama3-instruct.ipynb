      "1. **No signs of forced entry or damage**: If your car was stolen without any signs of forced entry or damage to the doors, windows, or locks, it could suggest that the thief used a key or a spare key to gain access.\n",
      "2. **Unusual key activity**: Check your key fob's activity log or your car's keyless entry system's history to see if there were any unusual key fob usage or car unlocking events around the time of the theft.\n",
      "3. **Tampered ignition**: If the ignition system was tampered with, you might notice:\n",
      "\t* Loose screws or wires around the ignition switch.\n",
      "\t* A broken or damaged ignition cylinder.\n",
      "\t* Unusual wear or scratches on the ignition key.\n",
      "4. **No evidence of forced entry**: If the thief didn't break any windows, doors, or locks, it could indicate that they used a key or a spare key to gain access.\n",
      "5. **Unusual tire tracks or marks**: If the thief used a different type of tire or vehicle to steal your car, you might notice unusual tire tracks or marks on the ground or nearby surfaces.\n",
      "6. **Suspicious activity around your car**: If you noticed any suspicious activity around your car, such as someone lurking around or trying to hide, it could indicate that your car was targeted for theft.\n",
      "7. **No valuables left behind**: If your car was stolen and no valuables like purses, phones, or wallets were left behind, it could suggest that the thief was after the car itself.\n",
      "8. **Unusual fuel consumption**: If your car's fuel level is lower than expected, or if the fuel cap was left open, it could indicate that the thief drove your car for a short distance.\n",
      "9. **No alarm triggered**: If your car's alarm system didn't trigger when the thief stole your car, it could suggest that the thief disabled the alarm or knew how to bypass it.\n",
      "10. **Police investigation**: The police will investigate the theft and may find evidence that suggests your car was hotwired. They may also recover your car if it's been found and returned to its original location.\n",
