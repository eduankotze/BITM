# Business Intelligence and Text Mining Research Group
This is an online repository for articles and resources related to the UFS-BITM Research Group.

The research focus is on [Digital Text Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining) where we combine **[natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)** (practical applications on textual data), **[data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)** (data analysis and practical data visualization from large document collections) as well as **[machine and deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)**. 

There are currently [684](https://paperswithcode.com/sota) state-of-the-art tasks (or topics of interest) for Natural Language Processing research.

As a research group, applications are mainly centered around the following few topics of interest:
*	[text classification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/text-classification) / [document classification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/document-classification) / [topic modeling](https://paperswithcode.com/task/topic-models)
*	[hate speech detection](https://paperswithcode.com/task/hate-speech-detection) / [abusive language detection](https://paperswithcode.com/task/abuse-detection)	
*	[sentiment analysis](https://paperswithcode.com/area/natural-language-processing/sentiment-analysis)
*	[few-shot text classification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/few-shot-text-classification) / [few-shot learning](https://huggingface.co/blog/few-shot-learning-gpt-neo-and-inference-api)
*	[zero-shot classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/zero-shot-classification)
*	[language modelling](https://paperswithcode.com/task/language-modelling)
*	[chatbot (or conversational AI)](https://paperswithcode.com/task/chatbot) [PhD only]
*	[dialogue generation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/dialogue-generation) [PhD only]

## What is Natural Language Processing, Data Science and Machine Learning?
[Natural language processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. 

[Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data).

If you want to learn more what Natural Language Processing entails, then I highly recommend ["A Complete Guide to Natural Language Processing"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing/) by DeepLearning.Ai.

## Why our interest in Natural Language Processing?
We are of the opinion that natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in <b>language (mostly text)</b>: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, and now even ChatGPT. In the last decade, deep learning (or neural network) approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering associated with traditional machine learning (i.e. scikit-learn). It is important to learn the neccessary skills to design, implement and understand neural network language models to be relevant in the information age. 

## CSIA7915 (Natural Language Processing)
The module CSIA7915 was introduced and is highly recommended for newly enrolled MSc and PhD students who want to familiarise themselves with the current state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing.
